## About
**Burgers, Yum!** is a full-stack app that uses RESTful API calls to a MySQL database to:
1. Store delicious burgers and whether they've been devoured yet
2. Mark said delicious burgers as devoured
3. Add new delicious burgers for us to devour

*Additionally, if you can't think of a clever name for your burger, a blank submission will randomly generate one for you using the random-word NPM package*
